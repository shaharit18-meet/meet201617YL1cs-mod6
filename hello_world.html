<!-- 1. On the top of this document (above the comments), write the doctype. -->

<html> 
<head>
<title> website </title>
this is our first html website in MEET
</head>
<body>
<h1> text <h1>
<h2>another text</h2>
<h3>last one before the paragraph</h3>
<p>This is the paragraph.<br>
The paragraph needs to include <strong>bold</strong> and unbold text. <br>
The paragraph also needs to include some links. <br>
So there is a few links: <br>
<a href="http://www.ebay.com/">ebay </a> <br>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en">instagram</a> <br>
<a href="https://he-il.facebook.com/">facebook</a> <br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia</a> <br>
The paragraph also needs to include some pictures. <br>
I found 2 pictures inside this directory. <br>
<strong> Here they are: </strong> <br><br>
<img src="TurtleAndStrawberry.jpg"> <br> 
<img src="HtmlHeadBody.png">

</p>
</body>
</html>
<!-- 3. In between these, write the <head> start and end tags -->
<!-- 4. In the head, write the <title> tags, and include a title -->
<!-- 5. Next, write the <body> start and end tags - these are still inside the <html> element -->
<!-- 6. In the body, make headings using tags like <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.  Ex.: <h1>Big heading</h1> -->
<!-- 7. Write paragraphs using the <p> start and end tags. -->
<!-- 7. Put text, line breaks, bold text, links, and images in your paragraph tags. -->
<!-- When you're done, go to the terminal and type

firefox hello_world.html

to view your file.  Then, debug and clean, and finally, push to GitHub.  -->
